# T.H.E YOU Creator 🍳

I'm [Pierre-Henry Soria](http://ph7.me/about-me/), a passionate software developer. I love writing too, and learning new things everyday. I post on a daily basis, new interesting and short thoughts about what I learnt at [Daily Learning Habit](http://dailylearninghabit.com) 🚣

I'm also the founder of [pH7's Social Dating Builder](https://github.com/pH7Software/pH7-Social-Dating-CMS) and hundreds of open source projects too 😊 (a  few are available [here](https://github.com/pH-7?tab=repositories) on my GitHub profile).
