# "YOU" Framework
The O.N.L.Y Web CMS which has been inspired by Caroline Kepnes's book 🔮 This is also a spooky narcissistic framework 👻


# T.H.E YOU Creator 🍳

I'm [Pierre-Henry Soria](http://ph7.me/about-me/), a SUPER Passionate, Belgian Software Engineer. 

I love writing too (non-fiction books), and learning new things every day.

I post on a daily basis at [Daily Learning Habit](http://dailylearninghabit.com), new interesting and short thoughts about what I learnt during the day, or the past few days in order to share with others (and learn more efficiency what I just read/heard). 
It's kinna a "personal notebook" for myself...🚣

Finally, I'm also the founder of [pH7's Social Dating Builder](https://github.com/pH7Software/pH7-Social-Dating-CMS) and hundreds of open source projects too 😊 (a  few are available [here](https://github.com/pH-7?tab=repositories) on my GitHub profile).
